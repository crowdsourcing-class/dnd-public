## Character Creation

- Stats: Point buy 13-11-15-10-13-11
- Race: Human
- Background: Lucent Luminescence is an Acolyte who devotedly serves the God of Light.  Lucent idolizes a particular hero of their faith, a martyr named John Dark who gave his life for the light.  Lucent does not know the truth of John's death.  He was burned at the stake by his church.  Lucent was given an empty reliquary that once housed the burning heart of John Dark, and Lucent would die to recover this ancient relic of their faith.
